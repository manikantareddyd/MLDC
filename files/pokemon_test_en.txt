the pokémon anime series and films are a meta-series of adventures separate from the canon that most of the pokémon video games follow (with the exception of pokémon yellow, a game based loosely on the anime storyline). the anime follows the quest of the main character, ash ketchum (known as satoshi in japan) a pokémon master in training, as he and a small group of friends travel around the fictitious world of pokémon along with their pokémon partners. the original series, titled pocket monsters, or simply pokémon in western countries (often referred to as pokémon: gotta catch 'em all to distinguish it from the later series), begins with ash's first day as a pokémon trainer. his first (and signature) pokémon is a pikachu, differing from the games, where only bulbasaur, charmander, or squirtle could be chosen. the series follows the storyline of the original games, pokémon red and blue, in the region of kanto. accompanying ash on his journeys are brock, the pewter city gym leader, and misty, the youngest of the gym leader sisters from cerulean city. pokémon: adventures in the orange islands follows ash's adventures in the orange islands, a place unique to the anime, and replaces brock with tracey sketchit, an artist and "pokémon watcher". the next series, based on the second generation of games, include pokémon: johto journeys, pokémon: johto league champions, and pokémon: master quest, following the original trio of ash, brock, and misty in the western johto region.
the saga continues in pokémon: advanced, based on the third generation games. ash and company travel to hoenn, a southern region in the pokémon world. ash takes on the role of a teacher and mentor for a novice pokémon trainer named may. her brother max accompanies them, and though he isn't a trainer, he knows large amounts of handy information. brock (from the original series) soon catches up with ash, but misty has returned to cerulean city to tend to her duties as a gym leader (misty, along with other recurring characters, appears in the spin-off series pokémon chronicles). the advanced series concludes with the battle frontier saga, based on the emerald version and including aspects of firered and leafgreen. it ended with max leaving to pick his starter pokémon and may going to the grand festival in johto.
in the diamond and pearl series, based on the fourth generation games, ash, brock, and a new companion, an aspiring pokémon coordinator named dawn, travel through the region of sinnoh. at the end of the series, ash and brock return to kanto where brock begins to follow his newfound dream of becoming a pokémon doctor himself.
pocket monsters: best wishes!, based on the fifth generation games, features ash and pikachu traveling through the region of unova (isshu in japan) alongside two new companions, iris and cilan (dent in japan) who part ways with them after returning to kanto.
pocket monsters: xy (ポケットモンスターxy, poketo monsutā ekkusu wai), is the current airing series based on the sixth generation games, following ash and pikachu's journey through the region of kalos, accompanied by ash's childhood friend serena and the siblings clemont and bonnie.
in addition to the tv series, seventeen pokémon films have been made, with the pair of films, pokémon the movie: black—victini and reshiram and white—victini and zekrom considered together as one. collectible bonuses, such as promotional trading cards, have been available with some of the films. various children's books, collectively known as pokémon junior, are also based on the anime.
