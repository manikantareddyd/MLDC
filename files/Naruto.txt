== plot ==

a powerful fox known as the nine-tails attacks the ninja village konoha. in response, the leader of konoha – the fourth hokage – seals the fox inside his newborn son naruto uzumaki at the cost of his life. as a child, naruto is isolated from the konoha community, who regards him as if he was the nine-tails itself and treat him with hostility. a decree made by the current hokage, the third hokage, forbids anyone mentioning the nine-tails to anyone else to prevent naruto from finding out the truth. twelve years later, renegade ninja mizuki reveals the truth to naruto before being defeated by him with the shadow clone jutsu, earning the respect of his teacher iruka umino. shortly after, naruto becomes a ninja and is assigned alongside sasuke uchiha, whom he often competes against, and sakura haruno, whom he has a crush on, to form a three-person team named team 7 under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja kakashi hatake. like all the ninja teams from every village, team 7 is charged with completing missions requested by villagers, ranging from doing chores, and being bodyguards or executing assassinations.
after several missions, most notably one to the land of waves, kakashi allows team 7 to participate in a ninja exam in which they can advance to a higher rank, and thus take part in more difficult missions. during the exams, orochimaru, a top-wanted criminal, invades konoha and kills the third hokage in an act of revenge. this forces one of the three legendary ninja, jiraiya, to search with naruto for tsunade, who has been nominated to become the fifth hokage. during the search, it is revealed that orochimaru desires to acquire sasuke due to his powerful genetic heritage, the sharingan. he also wants to use sasuke as a vessel; he believes he can become immortal this way, sealing his soul inside of sasuke's body. believing orochimaru will be able to give him the strength needed to kill his older brother itachi, who destroyed their clan, sasuke eventually joins him after a humiliating defeat at his brother's hands. tsunade sends a group of ninja including naruto to retrieve sasuke, but naruto is unable to bring him back to the village. naruto and sakura do not give up on sasuke however, and the former leaves konoha to train under jiraiya's tutelage in order to prepare himself for the next time he encounters sasuke, while the latter becomes tsunade's apprentice to become a medical ninja and gain her immense physical strength.
two and a half years later, naruto returns from his training with jiraiya, and the criminal organization called akatsuki, from which itachi is a member, starts kidnapping the hosts of the nine powerful tailed beasts, including the nine-tails sealed inside of naruto, to extract them. several ninjas from konoha, including team 7, fight against the akatsuki members and search for their teammate sasuke. the akatsuki is successful in capturing seven of those creatures whose hosts are killed in the process, except for gaara, the host of the one-tail whose life is saved in time by naruto and his comrades. in the meantime, sasuke betrays orochimaru and faces itachi to take revenge. after itachi dies in battle, sasuke learns from the akatsuki founder tobi that itachi was ordered by konoha's superiors to destroy his clan to prevent a coup d'état to which he accepted with the condition of allowing sasuke to be spared. saddened with this revelation, sasuke creates his own group called taka and joins forces with the akatsuki, in order to kill konoha's superiors who orchestrated the uchihas' elimination and destroy konoha to exact revenge. meanwhile, as several akatsuki members are defeated by konoha ninjas, their figurehead leader, nagato, kills jiraiya and devastates konoha. however, naruto defeats and redeems him, reviving those who perished and earning the village's respect and admiration as a result.
with nagato's eventual death, tobi, while disguised as one of konoha's founding fathers madara uchiha, announces that he wants to obtain all nine of the tailed beasts in order to perform an illusion powerful enough to control all of humanity, in an effort to create supposedly world peace. the leaders of the five ninja villages refuse to aid him and instead join forces to confront tobi and his allies. this results in a fourth great ninja war between the unified armies of the five great countries (collectively known as the allied shinobi forces) and akatsuki's forces of zombie-like ninjas. naruto, and killer bee, the host of the eight-tails, head for the battlefield refusing to sit back as instructed. during the conflict, it is revealed that tobi is actually obito uchiha, kakashi's former teammate who was thought to be dead, but he was saved by the real madara and has been working with him ever since. as sasuke learns the history of konoha, including the circumstances that led to his clan's downfall, he decides to protect the village and rejoins naruto and sakura to stop madara and obito's plans, which is to unleash the ten-tails. however, madara's body ends up possessed by kaguya ōtsutsuki, an ancient princess that was the embodiment of the ten-tails and progenitor of all chakra, who intends to subdue all of mankind, and a reformed obito sacrifices himself to help team 7 stop her. once kaguya is sealed, madara dies as well, but sasuke takes advantage of the situation and takes control all the tailed beasts to realize his true goal of ending the current village system. naruto confronts sasuke to dissuade him, and after they almost kill each other in a final battle, sasuke admits defeat and reforms. after the war, kakashi is chosen to become the sixth hokage and pardons sasuke of his crimes. years later, kakashi steps down and naruto becomes the seventh hokage, while he and his friends raise the next generation of ninjas from the village.


== production ==
masashi kishimoto first created a one-shot of naruto for the august 1997 issue of akamaru jump. despite its high positive results in the reader poll, kishimoto thought "[the] art stinks and the story's a mess!" kishimoto was originally working on karakuri for the hop step award when, unsatisfied by the rough drafts, he decided to work on something different, which later formed into the manga series naruto. kishimoto has expressed concerns that the use of chakras and hand signs makes naruto too japanese, but still believes it to be an enjoyable read. when asked about what was naruto's main theme during part i, kishimoto answered that it is how people accept each other citing naruto's development across the series. kishimoto said that since he was unable to focus on romance during part i, he was to emphasize it more in part ii, the part of the manga beginning with volume 28, despite finding it difficult.
when originally creating the naruto story, kishimoto looked to other shōnen manga as influences for his work, although he attempted to make his characters as unique as possible. he based it on japanese culture. the separation of the characters into different teams was intended to give each group a specific flavor. kishimoto wished for each member to be "extreme", having a high amount of aptitude in one given attribute yet be talentless in another." the insertion of villains into the story was largely to have them act as a counterpoint to the characters' moral values. kishimoto has stated that this focus on illustrating the difference in values is central to his creation of villains to the point that, "i don't really think about them in combat." when drawing the characters, kishimoto consistently follows a five-step process: concept and rough sketch, drafting, inking, shading, and coloring. these steps are followed when he is drawing the actual manga and making the color illustrations that commonly adorn the cover of tankōbon, the cover of weekly shōnen jump, or other media, but the toolkit he utilizes occasionally changes. for instance, he utilized an airbrush for one illustration for a weekly shōnen jump cover, but decided not to use it for future drawings largely due to the cleanup required. for part ii, kishimoto said that he attempted to not "overdo the typical manga style" by not including "too much deformation" and keeping the panel layouts to make it easy for the reader to follow the plot. kishomoto said his drawing style changed from "the classic manga look to something a bit more realistic."
kishimoto added that, as naruto takes place in a "japanese fantasy world", he has set certain rules, in a systematic way so that he could easily "convey the story". kishimoto wanted to "draw on" the chinese zodiac tradition, which had a long-standing presence in japan; the zodiac hand signs originate from this. when kishimoto was creating the setting of the naruto manga, he initially concentrated on the designs for village of konohagakure, the primary setting of the series. kishimoto asserts that his design for konohagakure was created "pretty spontaneously without much thought", but admits that the scenery is based on his home in the okayama prefecture in japan. without a specific time period, kishimoto included modern elements in the series such as convenience stores, but specifically excluded projectile weapons and vehicles from the storyline. for reference materials, kishimoto performs his own research into japanese culture and alludes to it in his work. regarding technology kishimoto said that naruto would not have any firearms. he said he may include automobiles, aircraft and "low-processing" computers; kishimoto specified the computers would "maybe" be eight-bit and that they would "definitely not" be sixteen-bit.
regarding the series' length, kishimoto showed surprise when the series reached its tenth volume as a result of its popularity. he has also stated at the time that he already had a visual idea of the last chapter of the series, including the text and the story. however, he noted that it could take a long time to end the series since "there are still so many things that need to be resolved."
